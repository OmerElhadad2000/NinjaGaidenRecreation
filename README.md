This project is a recreation of a level from the classic action-platformer Ninja Gaiden. The goal is to faithfully recreate one of the iconic levels from the original game, capturing its design, gameplay mechanics, and visual style. The project is a personal endeavor to sharpen game development skills, with a focus on level design, character movement, combat mechanics, and retro-inspired art.

In this recreation, I have aimed to replicate the original layout and challenges while applying modern tools and techniques in game development. The level features classic elements such as platforming challenges, enemy AI, and a dynamic combat system, all inspired by the original Ninja Gaiden gameplay.

The project showcases my skills in working with Unity, focusing on 2D game development and level design, with attention to detail in creating an engaging experience that mirrors the feel of the original game.

This project serves as both a learning experience and a tribute to a classic in the action-platformer genre.
